About Me / Background
------
I'm from South Florida, and I currently live in Tallahassee while I work on my Bachelor's degree in Statistics, with minors in Computational Science and Psychology.

I enjoy nerdy stuff like underground rap music and japanese minimal ambient music, london fog teas, and walks through nature with my girlfriend.

My goal is to earn a PhD in Computational Neuroscience, Statistics, or both (I'm looking at you, CMU...). I did a summer internship at Carnegie Mellon University in computational neuroscience in 2024 working under the mentorship of Timothy Verstynen, Ph.D. and Ph.D. Candidate Jack Burgess, where I mainly got familiar with the general basics of computational science such as using the command line and conda environments. 

I also did a summer internship in computational neuroscience at Brown University in 2025 working under the mentorship of Mohamed Sherif M.D., Ph.D., and Santiago Enriquez M.Eng., where I familiarized myself with the Thousand Brains Project's [Monty Sensorimotor Learning System](https://thousandbrainsproject.readme.io/docs/welcome-to-the-thousand-brains-project-documentation). I am currently contiuning my work on Monty and perhaps will be until I graduate in Spring 2027, because it is relevant to my interests in Computational Psychiatry.

I founded CompNeuroSociety at FSU in Spring 2025 out of a desire to build a community around computational neuroscience at my current institution, and to open an avenue to keep developing my skills in my preferred field of study while taking classes at FSU. I applied to and was awarded the [Open Research Community Accelerator - Cataltyic Awards Program Grant](https://www.orcaopen.org/work/cap/#About-the-Program) for $14,450 (up to $15,000) to support our collaborative research project being mentored by the Rodrigo Pena, Ph.D., Juan Lopez, Ph.D., and Ph.D. Candidate Ty Roachford (Stiles Nicholson Brain Institute, Florida Atlantic University) and with a sister branch of CompNeuroSociety founded Spring 2026 led by Ethan Johnson (Florida International University)
